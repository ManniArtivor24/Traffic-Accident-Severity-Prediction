Traffic Accident Severity Prediction

Objective

Build a machine learning model to predict the severity of traffic accidents (minor, serious, or fatal) using features such as weather conditions, road types, vehicle types, and time of day. This project aims to assist authorities in prioritizing resources and identifying factors contributing to severe accidents.

Project Pipeline

1. Problem Definition

Goal: Predict traffic accident severity (Minor, Serious, Fatal).

Business Value: Insights into accident risk factors allow for better resource allocation, safety improvements, and preventive measures.

Target Variable: Accident_Severity (Minor, Serious, Fatal).

2. Data Collection

Dataset: UK Traffic Accident Dataset

Key Features:
Weather_Conditions: Weather at the time of the accident.
Road_Type: Road type (e.g., single or dual carriageway).
Vehicle_Type: Type of vehicle involved.
Time_of_Day: Accident time (morning, evening).
Light_Conditions: Daylight or nighttime.
Number_of_Vehicles, Number_of_Casualties.
Speed_Limit: Speed on the road.

3. Data Preprocessing

Steps:
Handle missing values in key features.
Convert categorical variables (e.g., Weather_Conditions, Road_Type) using label encoding or one-hot encoding.
Scale continuous variables (Speed_Limit, Number_of_Vehicles) using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler.
Handle imbalanced data with techniques like SMOTE.

Tools: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Correlation Analysis: Analyze feature relationships (e.g., speed limits vs. severity).

Visualization: Use plots to explore accident distribution by time, weather, and road conditions.

Key Insights: Identify critical factors affecting accident severity.

Tools: matplotlib, seaborn.

5. Feature Engineering

Create time-based features: Convert Time_of_Day into time bins (e.g., morning, evening).
Create interaction terms (e.g., Weather_Conditions * Road_Type).
Aggregate features (e.g., Avg_Speed_Limit for multi-vehicle accidents).
Tools: pandas, scikit-learn.

6. Model Selection and Training

Models to Try:

Random Forest (scikit-learn)
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) (xgboost)
Logistic Regression (scikit-learn)
LightGBM (lightgbm)

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy: General performance.
Confusion Matrix: Class-wise performance.
F1-Score: Important for imbalanced classes.
AUC-ROC: Measures classifier performance.
Cross-Validation: Use k-fold cross-validation for generalizability.

7. Model Tuning

Hyperparameter Tuning: Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize parameters like max_depth, n_estimators, learning_rate.
Cross-Validation: Ensure the model is not overfitting.
Tools: scikit-learn.

8. Model Evaluation

Evaluate the model on a test set.
Use Confusion Matrix and F1-Score to analyze performance.
Use SHAP to explain feature importance.
Tools: scikit-learn, SHAP.
9. Deployment

Optional Web App: Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit for real-time predictions.
API: Serve predictions via an API using Flask.
Tools: Flask, Streamlit, Heroku.
